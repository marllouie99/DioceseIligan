          <h2>Research Team</h2>
          <p>This platform is developed by researchers from <strong>St. Michael's College of Iligan City</strong> as part of a comprehensive research study conducted in Iligan City, Philippines. The research demonstrates how modern web technologies can enhance transparency in charitable activities, improve parish-community communication, and allow parish staff to focus on their pastoral mission while efficiently managing administrative operations.</p>
          <p>The study addresses key problems identified in parishes across Iligan City, including the lack of centralized donation management systems, reliance on third-party social media for communication, and inefficient manual event reservation methods.</p>

          <h2>Our Vision</h2>
          <p>We envision a future where technology serves as a bridge between parishes and their communities in Iligan City, making it easier for parishioners to connect with their faith, participate in church activities, and support their local parishes. Through the Diocese of Iligan platform, we aim to empower parishes to better serve their communities while ensuring transparency, efficiency, and enhanced communication in the digital age.</p>
