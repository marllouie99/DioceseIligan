# 🔔 Chat Notifications Integration - COMPLETE!

## ✅ Status: FULLY INTEGRATED

Chat messages now create notifications in the topbar mail icon!

---

## 🎯 What Was Added

### Automatic Notifications
When someone sends you a chat message:
- ✅ **Notification appears** in topbar (mail icon)
- ✅ **Badge count updates** showing unread count
- ✅ **Click notification** to go to church page and open chat
- ✅ **Shows message preview** in notification dropdown

---

## 📦 Implementation Details

### 1. Signal Handler ✅
**File**: `core/chat_signals.py`

Created Django signal that triggers when a new message is saved:
- Listens to `Message` model `post_save` signal
- Determines recipient (user or church owner)
- Creates `Notification` object automatically
- Includes message preview and sender name

### 2. Signal Registration ✅
**File**: `core/apps.py`

Registered the signal in the app's `ready()` method:
```python
def ready(self):
    import core.signals
    import core.chat_signals  # ← Added this
```
