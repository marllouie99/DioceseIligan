# Profile Page Layout Fix - Warning Indicator Issue

## Problem
Warning indicators (orange dots) were appearing on the navigation tabs when clicking them. This was caused by the profile card being positioned **below** the tabs, which triggered validation warnings that displayed on the tabs above.

## Solution
Repositioned the profile card to appear **above** the navigation tabs instead of below them.

## Changes Made

### 1. HTML Structure (`templates/manage_profile.html`)

**Before:**
```
Page Header
└─ Navigation Tabs (Overview, Activity, Donations, Settings)
└─ Profile Card (with avatar, name, email, etc.)
└─ Tab Content
```

**After:**
```
Page Header
└─ Profile Card (with avatar, name, email, etc.)
└─ Navigation Tabs (Overview, Activity, Donations, Settings)
└─ Tab Content
```

**What Changed:**
- Moved the entire profile card section (lines 163-217) to appear **before** the navigation tabs
- Profile card now displays immediately after the page header
- Navigation tabs now appear below the profile card

### 2. CSS Styling (`static/css/pages/profile.css`)

**Updated `.profile-nav` styling:**
- Added `margin-top: 1.5rem` to create proper spacing between profile card and tabs
- Maintained `margin-bottom: 2rem` for spacing before tab content
- All other styling remains unchanged

## Benefits

1. **No More Warning Indicators**: Profile card validation warnings no longer affect the tabs above
2. **Better Visual Hierarchy**: Profile information is now the first thing users see
3. **Improved UX**: More logical flow - user sees their profile first, then navigates to different sections
4. **Cleaner Layout**: Tabs are clearly separated from profile information

## Visual Result

The profile page now displays in this order:
1. **Page Header** - "My Profile" title
2. **Profile Card** - Avatar, name, email, bio, member since date, edit button
3. **Navigation Tabs** - Overview, Activity, Donations, Settings (with proper spacing)
4. **Tab Content** - Content for selected tab

The warning indicators will no longer appear on the tabs when clicking them because the profile card is now positioned above the tabs instead of below.

## Files Modified

1. `templates/manage_profile.html` - Restructured layout order
2. `static/css/pages/profile.css` - Added top margin to navigation tabs
