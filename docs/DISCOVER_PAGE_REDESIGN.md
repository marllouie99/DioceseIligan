# Discover Churches Page Redesign

## Overview
Redesigned the Discover Churches page to be consistent with other pages in the application and reduced the card size for a more compact, efficient layout.

## Changes Made

### 1. HTML Structure (`templates/core/discover.html`)
- **Added `page-container` class** to the main wrapper div for consistent page width and padding
- This aligns with other pages like Events, Church Detail, Following, and Appointments

### 2. CSS Styling (`static/css/pages/discover.css`)

#### Page Container Setup
- Implemented the standard page container pattern used across the app
- Set `--page-max-width: 1400px` and `--page-padding: 16px 24px`
- Added proper overflow and box-sizing rules

#### Page Header
- Applied the **Warm Sacred Earth theme** with parchment-style background
- Used the same gradient and texture patterns as church detail page
- Reduced font sizes: title from 32px to 28px, subtitle from 16px to 15px
- Reduced padding from 24px to 20px 24px
- Added smooth transitions matching other pages

#### Church Cards
- **Reduced card size significantly:**
  - Cover image height: 180px → 140px
  - Avatar size: 60px → 52px
  - Church name font: 18px → 16px
  - Location font: 14px → 13px
  - Description font: 14px → 13px
  - Detail items font: 13px → 12px
  - Badge padding: 4px 12px → 3px 10px
  - Badge font: 12px → 11px
  - Content padding: 20px → 16px
  - Header padding: 20px → 16px
  - Actions padding: 20px → 16px
  - Button padding: 12px 16px → 10px 14px
  - Button font: 14px → 13px
  - Icon sizes: 16px → 14px

- **Applied Warm Sacred Earth theme:**
  - Parchment-style card background with subtle textures
  - Warm brown borders: `rgba(139, 69, 19, 0.15)`
  - Matching shadows with brown tones
  - Consistent hover effects with theme colors

- **Improved grid layout:**
  - Changed from fixed 2 columns to responsive: `repeat(auto-fill, minmax(340px, 1fr))`
  - Reduced gap from 24px to 20px
  - Cards now adapt better to different screen sizes

#### Visual Consistency
- Matched border colors, shadows, and gradients with church detail page
- Applied consistent transition timing: `cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.46, 0.45, 0.94)`
- Used theme-consistent avatar gradients: `#0f766e` to `#059669`
- Maintained hover effects with proper scale and shadow changes

#### Typography & Spacing
- Reduced description line clamp from 3 to 2 lines
- Added text truncation for church names (1 line max)
- Improved spacing between elements for better visual hierarchy
- Reduced gaps throughout for more compact design

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: Now matches the design language of other pages (Events, Church Detail, Following)
2. **Efficiency**: Smaller cards allow more content to be visible at once
3. **Theme Alignment**: Fully integrated with Warm Sacred Earth theme
4. **Responsive**: Better grid system adapts to various screen sizes
5. **Performance**: Reduced visual weight improves perceived performance
6. **Readability**: Maintained readability while reducing size

## Visual Improvements

- Parchment-style backgrounds with subtle textures
- Warm brown color scheme throughout
- Smooth hover animations and transitions
- Better visual hierarchy with reduced sizes
- More professional and cohesive appearance

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test on different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile)
2. Verify card hover effects work smoothly
3. Check that all text is readable at new sizes
4. Ensure follow/unfollow functionality still works
5. Verify search and filter functionality
6. Test pagination if applicable

## Latest Update (2025-10-12 15:07)

### Church Cards Now Inside Unified Section
- **Moved church cards inside the results container** for a cohesive layout
- Created new `.results-container` wrapper that includes both results summary and churches grid
- Search section, results summary, and church cards now all appear as one unified white section
- Reduced card shadows to be more subtle since they're now inside a container
- Added subtle border-bottom separator between results count and cards
- Empty state now uses transparent background with dashed border

**Visual Changes:**
- Search section: Rounded top corners only
- Results container: Rounded bottom corners, contains results count + church cards
- Church cards: Lighter shadows (2px 8px instead of 4px 12px)
- Hover effect: Reduced from 4px to 2px lift for subtlety
- Empty state: Transparent with dashed border to match container style

**Result**: The entire discover interface now appears as one cohesive white card section, with search at top and results/cards inside.
