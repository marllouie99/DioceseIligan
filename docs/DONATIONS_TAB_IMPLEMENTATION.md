# Donations Tab Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a fully functional donations tab on the user profile page to track donation activities and display donation history with statistics.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Changes (`accounts/views.py`)

#### Updated `manage_profile` view:
- Added import for `Donation` model from `core.models`
- Fetched user's donations with related church and post data (optimized with `select_related`)
- Calculated donation statistics:
  - `total_donated`: Sum of all completed donations
  - `donation_count`: Number of completed donations
- Limited donation history to 20 most recent donations
- Added context variables: `user_donations`, `total_donated`, `donation_count`

**Code Added:**
```python
# Get user's donations
user_donations = Donation.objects.filter(
    donor=request.user
).select_related('post', 'post__church').order_by('-created_at')[:20]

# Calculate donation statistics
from django.db.models import Sum, Count
donation_stats = Donation.objects.filter(
    donor=request.user,
    payment_status='completed'
).aggregate(
    total_donated=Sum('amount'),
    donation_count=Count('id')
)
```

### 2. Frontend Changes (`templates/manage_profile.html`)

#### Added Activity Tab Content:
- Full activity history display (15 activities)
- Activity icons based on activity type
- Empty state when no activities exist

#### Added Donations Tab Content:
- **Donation Statistics Cards:**
  - Total Donated amount (‚Ç±)
  - Number of donations made
  - Beautiful card design with icons

- **Donation History List:**
  - Church avatar/logo
  - Church name (clickable link to church detail)
  - Post preview (truncated)
  - Donation message (if provided)
  - Donation amount
  - Payment status badge (completed, pending, failed, cancelled, refunded)
  - Donation date
  - Payment method (PayPal, Credit Card, etc.)

- **Empty State:**
  - Friendly message when no donations exist
  - Call-to-action button to discover churches

#### Features:
- Responsive design for mobile and tablet
- Status badges with color coding:
  - ‚úÖ Completed (green)
  - ‚è±Ô∏è Pending (yellow)
  - ‚ùå Failed/Cancelled (red)
  - üîÑ Refunded (blue)
- Payment method icons (PayPal logo, credit card icon)
- Hover effects on donation items
- Clean, organized layout

### 3. CSS Styling (`static/css/pages/profile.css`)

#### Added comprehensive styling for:
- `.donations-page-content` - Main container
- `.donation-stats-grid` - Statistics cards grid
- `.donations-list` - Donation items list
- `.donation-item` - Individual donation card
- `.donation-church-info` - Church information section
- `.donation-meta` - Donation metadata (amount, status, date)
- `.status-badge` - Status indicators with colors
- `.empty-donations` - Empty state styling
- `.activity-page-content` - Activity tab container

#### Responsive breakpoints:
- Desktop: Full layout with side-by-side information
- Tablet (768px): Stacked layout for donation items
- Mobile (480px): Simplified layout with full-width elements

#### Design Features:
- Warm parchment texture background (consistent with app theme)
- Smooth hover animations
- Color-coded status badges
- Icon integration for visual clarity
- Professional card-based design

## Database Query Optimization

The implementation uses Django ORM optimization techniques:
- `select_related('post', 'post__church')` - Reduces database queries by pre-fetching related objects
- `aggregate()` - Efficient database-level calculations for statistics
- Limited queries to 20 most recent donations to prevent performance issues

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Visual Feedback:**
   - Clear status indicators for each donation
   - Color-coded badges for quick status recognition
   - Icons for payment methods

2. **Information Hierarchy:**
   - Most important info (amount, status) prominently displayed
   - Supporting details (date, method) in smaller text
   - Optional donation messages highlighted

3. **Navigation:**
   - Clickable church names link to church detail pages
   - "Discover Churches" button in empty state

4. **Responsive Design:**
   - Adapts to all screen sizes
   - Touch-friendly on mobile devices
   - Maintains readability on small screens

## Testing Recommendations

1. **With Donations:**
   - Verify all donation statuses display correctly
   - Check that amounts format properly (‚Ç±XX.XX)
   - Confirm church links work
   - Test donation messages display

2. **Without Donations:**
   - Verify empty state displays
   - Check "Discover Churches" button works
   - Confirm statistics show ‚Ç±0.00 and 0 donations

3. **Responsive Testing:**
   - Test on mobile devices (320px - 480px)
   - Test on tablets (768px - 1024px)
   - Test on desktop (1024px+)

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - Very long church names
   - Very long donation messages
   - Large donation amounts
   - Multiple donations to same church

## Future Enhancements

Consider adding:
1. Filter donations by status (completed, pending, etc.)
2. Date range filtering
3. Export donation history as PDF/CSV
4. Donation receipts download
5. Search functionality for specific churches
6. Pagination for users with many donations
7. Donation analytics charts (monthly trends, etc.)

## Files Modified

1. `accounts/views.py` - Added donation data fetching
2. `templates/manage_profile.html` - Added donations and activity tab content
3. `static/css/pages/profile.css` - Added styling for donations tab

## Dependencies

- Existing `Donation` model in `core/models.py`
- Django ORM for database queries
- Template filters: `floatformat`, `date`, `truncatewords`

## Notes

- The donations tab now properly fetches and displays user donation data
- The Activity tab was also implemented as it was missing from the template
- All styling follows the existing warm parchment theme of the application
- The implementation is fully responsive and mobile-friendly
