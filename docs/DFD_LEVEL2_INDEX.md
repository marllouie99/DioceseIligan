## üé® Diagram Notation

All Level 2 DFDs use standard notation:
- **Rectangle:** Sub-process
- **Parallel lines:** Data store
- **Rectangle (external):** External entity
- **Arrow:** Data flow
- **Dashed box:** Process boundary

---

## üí° Usage Guidelines

1. **Start with Level 1 DFD** to understand overall system
2. **Drill down to Level 2** for detailed process logic
3. **Use for development** to implement features
4. **Use for testing** to create test cases
5. **Use for documentation** to explain system behavior

## üîç Next Steps

### **Processes Not Yet Decomposed:**
- Process 2.0: Church Profile Management
- Process 6.0: Messaging & Communication
- Process 7.0: Review & Rating Management
- Process 8.0: Notification Management
- Process 9.0: Analytics & Tracking

These can be decomposed in future iterations if needed.
