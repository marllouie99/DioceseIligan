# Sidebar Activity Display Fix

## Issue
The sidebar was only showing 1 authentication activity (e.g., "google_login") while the profile page showed multiple post interactions (likes, views, follows, etc.).

## Root Cause
- **Sidebar** was displaying `UserActivity` model (authentication events: logins, registrations)
- **Profile page** was displaying `UserInteraction` model (post interactions: likes, comments, views, follows)
- These are two separate activity tracking systems

## Solution
Updated the sidebar to display **post interactions** (`UserInteraction` model) instead of authentication activities, making it consistent with the profile page and more useful for users.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Sidebar Template
**File:** `templates/partials/sidebar.html`

- Changed from checking `activity.activity_type` (UserActivity fields) to `activity.icon_class` (UserInteraction properties)
- Changed from displaying `activity.get_activity_type_display` to `activity.activity_description`
- Added proper icons for all interaction types:
  - ‚ù§Ô∏è Heart - Like/Unlike posts
  - üí¨ Message - Comments
  - üîñ Bookmark - Saved posts
  - üëÅÔ∏è Eye - Post views
  - üîó Share - Shared posts
  - üë§+ User Plus - Follow church
  - üë§- User Minus - Unfollow church
  - üìÖ+ Calendar Plus - Booking created
  - ‚úèÔ∏è Edit - Various updates
  - ‚≠ê Star - Reviews

### 2. Updated Home/Landing View
**File:** `accounts/views.py` - `landing()` function

Changed from:
```python
from accounts.models import UserActivity
recent_activities = UserActivity.objects.filter(user=request.user)...
```

To:
```python
from core.models import UserInteraction
recent_activities = UserInteraction.objects.filter(user=request.user)
    .select_related('content_type')
    .prefetch_related('content_object')
    .order_by('-created_at')[:5]
```

### 3. Updated Global Context Function
**File:** `core/views.py` - `get_context_data()` function

Same change as above - now provides `UserInteraction` activities instead of `UserActivity`.

### 4. Profile View Already Correct
**File:** `accounts/views.py` - `manage_profile()` function

Already provides both:
- `recent_activities` - UserInteraction for profile page content
- `recent_auth_activities` - UserActivity (kept for potential future use)

## Result

### Before
- **Sidebar:** Only showed 1 authentication activity ("google_login")
- **Profile page:** Showed multiple post interactions

### After
- **Sidebar:** Shows up to 5 recent post interactions across all pages
- **Profile page:** Shows up to 15 post interactions in main content
- Both display the same type of activities, maintaining consistency

## Activity Types Now Displayed in Sidebar

Users will now see their recent:
- Post likes/unlikes
- Post comments (including replies)
- Post bookmarks/unbookmarks
- Post views
- Post shares
- Church follows/unfollows
- Booking creations/updates/cancellations
- Service reviews
- Profile updates

## Benefits

1. **More Relevant Information** - Users see their actual content interactions, not just logins
2. **Consistency** - Sidebar and profile page show the same type of activities
3. **Better Engagement** - Users can quickly see their recent interactions across the platform
4. **Activity Awareness** - Reminds users of what they've been doing on the platform

## Authentication Activities

Authentication activities (logins, registrations, password resets) are still being tracked in the `UserActivity` model and stored in the database. They're just not displayed in the sidebar anymore. They can be:
- Viewed in the admin panel
- Used for security auditing
- Displayed in a dedicated security/account activity page (future enhancement)

## Future Enhancements

1. **Filter Toggle** - Allow users to switch between post interactions and auth activities in sidebar
2. **Activity Settings** - Let users choose which activity types to display
3. **Activity Limit Control** - Allow users to show more/fewer activities
4. **Security Tab** - Create dedicated page for viewing authentication activities
5. **Combined View** - Mix both types of activities with visual distinction
