## 🎨 How Avatars Work

### For Regular Users (viewing church):
- **Header**: Shows church logo
- **Church messages**: Show church logo
- **User messages**: Show user's profile picture (or placeholder if none)

### For Church Owners (viewing user conversations):
- **Header**: Shows user's profile picture (or placeholder if none)
- **User messages**: Show user's profile picture (or placeholder if none)
- **Church messages**: Show church logo

---

## 🔍 Why You See Placeholders

### Common Reasons:

1. **User hasn't uploaded a profile picture**
   - This is the most common reason
   - The system shows a default SVG placeholder
   - This is normal and expected behavior

2. **Profile doesn't exist yet**
   - New users might not have profiles created
   - System handles this gracefully with fallbacks

3. **Avatar file was deleted**
   - If the uploaded file was removed from media folder
   - System falls back to placeholder

---

## 📝 How to Fix "Missing" Avatars

### For Users:
1. Go to **Manage Profile**
2. Click **Edit Profile**
3. Upload a profile picture
4. Save changes
5. Refresh chat - avatar now appears!

### For Church Owners:
- Church logo is set in **Manage Church** → **Settings**
- Upload church logo there
- It will appear in all chat conversations

## 🎯 Current Behavior (Correct)

### Scenario 1: User with Profile Picture
```
Header: [User Photo] Ramdar marl
Messages:
  [User Photo] hello
  [Church Logo] Hi! what may i help you?
```

### Scenario 2: User without Profile Picture (Your Case)
```
Header: [Placeholder] Ramdar marl
Messages:
  [Placeholder] hello
  [Church Logo] Hi! what may i help you?
```

This is **working correctly** - the placeholder appears because the user hasn't uploaded a profile picture yet.

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Avatar Priority (for users):
1. **First choice**: User's uploaded profile picture
2. **Fallback**: SVG placeholder icon

### Avatar Priority (for church owners):
1. **First choice**: Church's uploaded logo
2. **Fallback**: SVG placeholder icon

### API Response:
```json
{
  "church_avatar": "/media/profiles/user123.jpg",  // or null if no picture
  "church_name": "Ramdar marl"
}
```

When `church_avatar` is `null`, the frontend displays the placeholder.

   - Show "Complete your profile" prompts
   - Highlight missing profile picture

## 🔧 Code Improvements Made

```python
# Before
if hasattr(conv.user, 'profile') and conv.user.profile:
    if conv.user.profile.avatar:

# After (with debugging)
if hasattr(conv.user, 'profile'):
    profile = getattr(conv.user, 'profile', None)
    if profile and profile.avatar:
        avatar = profile.avatar.url
```

### Added Logging:
