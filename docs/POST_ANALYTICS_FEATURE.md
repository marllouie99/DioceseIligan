   - Shows percentage better/worse than average

2. **Peak Engagement Time**
   - Identifies when most interactions occurred
   - Helps optimize future posting times

**Post Metadata:**

## Technical Implementation

### Backend (`core/views.py`)

**New View Function: `get_post_analytics(request, post_id)`**
- Fetches comprehensive analytics data for a specific post
- Calculates engagement metrics and rates
- Generates hourly breakdown data (last 24 hours)
- Compares performance against church average
- Returns JSON response with all analytics data

**Key Calculations:**
- Engagement rate: `(total_interactions / views) * 100`
- Hourly views and interactions tracking
- Audience segmentation (followers vs non-followers)
- Performance comparison with church average

### Models (`core/models.py`)

**New Model: `CommentLike`**
- Tracks likes on individual comments
- Fields: user, comment, created_at
- Unique constraint on user-comment pair
- Indexed for performance

**Enhanced `PostComment` Model:**
- Added `time_ago` property for human-readable timestamps
- Consistent with Post model's time display

### URL Configuration (`core/urls.py`)
- Added route: `/posts/<int:post_id>/analytics/`
- Maps to `get_post_analytics` view

### Frontend

**HTML Template (`templates/partials/manage/post_analytics_modal.html`):**
- Comprehensive modal structure
- Semantic HTML with proper accessibility
- Responsive grid layouts
- Canvas elements for Chart.js integration

**CSS Styles (`static/css/components/post_analytics_modal.css`):**
- Modern, clean design
- Responsive breakpoints for mobile, tablet, desktop
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Color-coded analytics cards
- Professional chart containers
- Hover effects and interactive elements

**JavaScript (`static/js/components/post_analytics_modal.js`):**
- `viewPost(postId)` - Opens modal and loads data
- `closePostAnalyticsModal()` - Closes modal and cleans up
- `loadPostAnalytics(postId)` - Fetches data from backend
- `populateAnalyticsModal(analytics)` - Populates all sections
- `renderViewsInteractionsChart()` - Creates line chart
- `renderEngagementBreakdownChart()` - Creates bar chart
- Chart.js integration for interactive visualizations
- Error handling and loading states
- Keyboard navigation (ESC to close)

### Integration

**Updated Files:**
1. `templates/partials/manage/modals.html` - Added analytics modal include
2. `templates/core/manage_church.html` - Added CSS and JS references
3. `core/admin.py` - Registered CommentLike model

## Database Changes

### New Model
- `CommentLike` - Tracks comment likes for analytics

### Migration Required

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

8. **A/B Testing** - Test different post formats
9. **Sentiment Analysis** - Analyze comment sentiment
10. **Geographic Data** - Show where views are coming from

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizations Implemented:
- Database query optimization with `select_related()`
- Indexed fields for faster lookups
- Efficient aggregation queries
- Client-side chart rendering
- Lazy loading of modal content
- Memory cleanup on modal close

### Recommendations:
- Consider caching analytics data for popular posts
- Implement pagination for large comment lists
- Add database indexes on frequently queried fields
- Use Redis for real-time analytics tracking

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Modal opens correctly when clicking View button
- [ ] All analytics data displays accurately
- [ ] Charts render properly with correct data
- [ ] Edit button redirects to edit modal
- [ ] Delete button triggers delete confirmation
- [ ] Modal closes on overlay click
- [ ] Modal closes on ESC key press
- [ ] Responsive design works on mobile
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Performance is acceptable with large datasets

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**Modal doesn't open:**
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify Chart.js is loaded
- Ensure post ID is valid

**Charts not rendering:**
- Verify Chart.js CDN is accessible
- Check canvas element IDs match JavaScript
- Ensure data format is correct

**Slow loading:**
- Check database query performance
- Consider adding indexes
- Implement caching for frequently accessed posts

**Data not updating:**
- Clear browser cache
- Check CSRF token is valid
- Verify API endpoint is accessible

## Security Considerations

- **Authentication Required**: Only church owners can view analytics
- **Authorization Check**: Validates user owns the church
- **XSS Prevention**: HTML escaping for user content
- **CSRF Protection**: Token validation on requests
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Using Django ORM parameterized queries

## Conclusion

This feature provides church administrators with powerful insights into their post performance, helping them understand their audience better and optimize their content strategy. The implementation follows Django best practices and maintains consistency with the existing codebase design patterns.
