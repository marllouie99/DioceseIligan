# Enhanced Conflict Detection for Appointments

## Summary
Enhanced the conflict detection system to include same-user conflicts and improved visual highlighting for conflict rows in the appointments table.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Conflict Detection Logic ✅
**File:** `core/views.py` (manage_church function)

**Previous Behavior:**
- Only detected conflicts when multiple bookings existed on the same date for the same church

**New Behavior:**
- **Date Conflicts**: Multiple bookings on the same date (existing functionality)
- **User Conflicts**: Same user booking multiple services on the same date (NEW)

**Implementation:**
```python
# Detect date conflicts (multiple bookings on same date)
active_keys = list(active_bookings.values('church_id', 'date'))
key_counter = Counter((k['church_id'], k['date']) for k in active_keys)
date_conflicts = {(cid, d) for (cid, d), c in key_counter.items() if c > 1}

# Detect user conflicts (same user booking multiple services on same date)
user_date_keys = list(active_bookings.values('user_id', 'date'))
user_date_counter = Counter((k['user_id'], k['date']) for k in user_date_keys)
user_conflicts = {(uid, d) for (uid, d), c in user_date_counter.items() if c > 1}

# Mark conflicts for template usage
for b in bookings:
    has_date_conflict = (b.church_id, b.date) in date_conflicts
    has_user_conflict = (b.user_id, b.date) in user_conflicts
    setattr(b, 'is_conflict', has_date_conflict or has_user_conflict)
    setattr(b, 'conflict_type', 'date' if has_date_conflict else ('user' if has_user_conflict else None))
```

### 2. Enhanced Visual Highlighting ✅
**Files:** 
- `templates/core/partials/appointments_list.html`
- `static/css/pages/manage-church.css`

**Visual Enhancements:**

#### A. Entire Row Highlighting
- Conflict rows now have a red gradient background
- 4px red left border for immediate visibility
- Different hover state for better UX

#### B. Conflict Badge Improvements
- Bolder font weight (600)
- Stronger background color
- Pulsing animation to draw attention
- Tooltip showing conflict type

#### C. CSS Styling
```css
/* Highlight entire row for conflicts */
.appointments-table .appointment-row.conflict-row {
  background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(254, 226, 226, 0.4) 0%, rgba(254, 226, 226, 0.1) 100%);
  border-left: 4px solid #ef4444;
  position: relative;
}

.appointments-table .appointment-row.conflict-row:hover {
  background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(254, 226, 226, 0.6) 0%, rgba(254, 226, 226, 0.2) 100%);
}

/* Pulsing animation for conflict badge */
@keyframes pulse-conflict {
  0%, 100% {
    box-shadow: 0 0 0 0 rgba(239, 68, 68, 0.4);
  }
  50% {
    box-shadow: 0 0 0 4px rgba(239, 68, 68, 0);
  }
}
```

### 3. Updated Template ✅
**File:** `templates/core/partials/appointments_list.html`

**Changes:**
- Added `conflict-row` class to rows with conflicts
- Enhanced conflict badge with tooltip
- Tooltip shows conflict type (date vs user conflict)

```html
<tr class="appointment-row {% if b.is_conflict %}conflict-row{% endif %}">
  ...
  <span class="status-badge status-conflict" 
        title="{% if b.conflict_type == 'date' %}Multiple bookings on same date{% else %}User has multiple bookings on this date{% endif %}">
    CONFLICT
  </span>
</tr>
```

## Conflict Types

### 1. Date Conflict
**Scenario:** Multiple different users book services on the same date
**Example:** 
- User A books Funeral on 2025-10-20
- User B books Wedding on 2025-10-20
- Both rows show CONFLICT badge

### 2. User Conflict (NEW)
**Scenario:** Same user books multiple services on the same date
**Example:**
- User A books Funeral on 2025-10-20 at 9:00 AM
- User A books Wedding on 2025-10-20 at 9:30 AM
- Both rows show CONFLICT badge

## Visual Features

### Before Enhancement:
- Small "Conflict" badge in status column
- No row highlighting
- Easy to miss conflicts

### After Enhancement:
- ✅ **Entire row highlighted** with red gradient background
- ✅ **4px red left border** for immediate visibility
- ✅ **Pulsing animation** on conflict badge
- ✅ **Bolder text** on conflict badge
- ✅ **Tooltip** showing conflict type
- ✅ **Enhanced hover state** for better UX

## User Experience

1. **Church Owner Views Appointments Tab**
   - Conflict rows immediately stand out with red highlighting
   - Left border makes conflicts visible even when scrolling

2. **Hover Over Conflict Badge**
   - Tooltip shows whether it's a date conflict or user conflict
   - Helps church owner understand the issue

3. **Pulsing Animation**
   - Subtle animation draws attention without being distracting
   - Ensures conflicts are noticed

## Technical Details

### Conflict Detection Scope
- Only checks **active bookings** (Requested, Reviewed, Approved)
- Ignores Completed, Declined, and Canceled bookings
- Runs on every page load for real-time detection

### Performance
- Uses Counter from collections for efficient conflict detection
- Single database query for all bookings
- In-memory processing for conflict marking

### Browser Compatibility
- CSS animations work on all modern browsers
- Graceful degradation for older browsers (no animation, but still highlighted)

## Files Modified

1. `core/views.py` - Enhanced conflict detection logic
2. `templates/core/partials/appointments_list.html` - Added row highlighting and tooltip
3. `static/css/pages/manage-church.css` - Added visual styling and animations

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test date conflict detection (multiple users, same date)
- [ ] Test user conflict detection (same user, multiple services, same date)
- [ ] Verify entire row is highlighted for conflicts
- [ ] Verify left border appears on conflict rows
- [ ] Test pulsing animation on conflict badge
- [ ] Hover over conflict badge to see tooltip
- [ ] Test hover state on conflict rows
- [ ] Verify conflicts only show for active bookings
- [ ] Test with no conflicts (should show normally)
- [ ] Test responsive design on mobile

## Examples

### Date Conflict Example:
```
Row 1: Funeral | User A | 2025-10-20 | CONFLICT (red highlighted)
Row 2: Wedding | User B | 2025-10-20 | CONFLICT (red highlighted)
```
Tooltip: "Multiple bookings on same date"

### User Conflict Example:
```
Row 1: Funeral | User A | 2025-10-20 | 9:00 AM | CONFLICT (red highlighted)
Row 2: Wedding | User A | 2025-10-20 | 9:30 AM | CONFLICT (red highlighted)
```
Tooltip: "User has multiple bookings on this date"

## Benefits

1. **Improved Visibility** - Conflicts are immediately noticeable
2. **Better UX** - Church owners can quickly identify scheduling issues
3. **Comprehensive Detection** - Catches both date and user conflicts
4. **Clear Communication** - Tooltips explain the conflict type
5. **Professional Design** - Subtle animations and gradients

## Suggestions & Recommendations

1. **Conflict Resolution** - Add a button to automatically resolve conflicts
2. **Conflict Warnings** - Show warning when creating a booking that would cause a conflict
3. **Email Alerts** - Notify church owner when a conflict is detected
4. **Conflict Report** - Generate a report of all conflicts for a date range
5. **Auto-Scheduling** - Suggest alternative dates/times to avoid conflicts
6. **Time Overlap Detection** - Check if service times overlap (not just dates)
7. **Capacity Management** - Allow multiple bookings if church has capacity
8. **Conflict Priority** - Mark which conflicts are more critical

## Notes

- Conflicts are detected in real-time on page load
- The system only flags conflicts, it doesn't prevent bookings
- Church owners can still approve conflicting bookings if needed
- Visual highlighting makes conflict management much easier
