## URL Structure

- **Access**: Restricted to superusers only

## Future Enhancements

### Suggested Improvements:

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Access Control**: Verify only superusers can access the page

3. **Search Functionality**: Test search with different keywords
4. **Responsive Design**: Test on mobile, tablet, and desktop
5. **Chart Rendering**: Verify charts display correctly with real data
6. **Empty States**: Test when no reports or verifications exist
7. **Performance**: Test with large datasets (100+ records)
