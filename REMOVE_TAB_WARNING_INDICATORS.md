# Remove Warning Indicators from Navigation Tabs

## Problem
Warning indicators (orange exclamation marks) were appearing on the active navigation tab when profile essentials were incomplete. This was visually distracting and no longer necessary since the profile card was repositioned above the tabs.

## Solution
Removed the CSS rule that displays warning indicators on active navigation tabs.

## Changes Made

### CSS Update (`static/css/app.css`)

**Removed:**
```css
.needs-essentials .nav-tab.active::after {
  content: '!';
  position: absolute;
  top: -4px;
  right: -6px;
  width: 16px;
  height: 16px;
  border-radius: 50%;
  background: #f59e0b;
  color: #fff;
  font-size: 10px;
  line-height: 16px;
  text-align: center;
  font-weight: 900;
}
```

**Replaced with:**
```css
/* Warning indicators on tabs removed - profile card is now above tabs */
```

## Rationale

1. **Profile Card Repositioned**: The profile card is now displayed **above** the navigation tabs (as of previous commit)
2. **Warning Source**: Any validation warnings from the profile card now appear above the tabs, not on them
3. **Cleaner UI**: Removing the indicator makes the tabs cleaner and less cluttered
4. **Better UX**: Users can still see warnings (on the Edit Profile button), but tabs remain clean for navigation

## Other Warning Indicators Still Active

The following warning indicators remain active and functional:
- ✅ Profile button in topbar (`.needs-essentials .profile-btn::after`)
- ✅ Edit Profile button (`.needs-essentials .edit-profile-btn::after`)
- ✅ Manage Profile dropdown item (`.needs-essentials .dropdown-item.manage-profile-item::after`)
- ✅ Form section titles (`.needs-essentials .profile-form .section-title::after`)
- ✅ Missing field labels in modal (`.needs-essentials .profile-edit-modal .form-group.is-missing .form-label::after`)

## Visual Result

**Before:**
- Active tab showed orange "!" indicator when profile was incomplete
- Indicator appeared on Overview, Activity, Donations, or Settings tab (whichever was active)

**After:**
- ✅ No warning indicators on navigation tabs
- ✅ Cleaner tab appearance
- ✅ Warning still visible on Edit Profile button
- ✅ Users can still identify incomplete profile through other indicators

## Files Modified

1. `static/css/app.css` - Removed `.needs-essentials .nav-tab.active::after` rule
