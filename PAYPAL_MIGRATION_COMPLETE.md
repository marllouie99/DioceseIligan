# PayPal Orders API v2 Migration Complete

## Summary
Successfully migrated from the deprecated PayPal Payments API to the modern **PayPal Orders API v2**. This resolves all sandbox errors and provides a better user experience.

---

## What Changed

### Backend (`core/donation_views.py`)
**Before:** Used `paypalrestsdk` Python library with Payments API
**After:** Uses `requests` library with Orders API v2

#### New Functions
- `get_paypal_access_token()` - OAuth2 authentication
- `create_donation_order()` - Creates PayPal order (returns `order_id`)
- `capture_donation()` - Captures payment after user approval
- `cancel_donation()` - Marks donation as cancelled
- `donation_success()`, `donation_failed()`, `donation_cancelled()` - Page views

#### Key Changes
- **No more redirects** - Everything happens in PayPal popup
- **Order ID instead of Payment ID** - Cleaner API structure
- **Direct REST API calls** - No SDK wrapper, more control
- **Better error handling** - Detailed logging and error messages

---

### Frontend (`static/js/components/donation.js`)
**Before:** Used old PayPal popup with redirect flow
**After:** Uses PayPal JS SDK Buttons with in-popup capture

#### Key Changes
- `createOrder()` - Returns `order_id` instead of `payment_id`
- `onApprove()` - Captures order via AJAX, then redirects to success page
- `onCancel()` - Calls cancel endpoint to mark donation as cancelled
- **No page redirects** during payment flow

---

### Templates
- **dashboard.html** - Added PayPal SDK script tag with dynamic currency
- **church_detail.html** - Added PayPal SDK and donation modal
- Both use `{{ PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID }}` and `{{ PAYPAL_CURRENCY }}` from context

---

### Context Updates
- **accounts/views.py** (`dashboard()`) - Added `PAYPAL_CURRENCY` to context
- **core/views.py** (`_app_context()`) - Added PayPal config to common context

---

### URL Routes (`core/urls.py`)
Added new endpoints:
- `/app/donations/capture/<post_id>/` - Capture order after approval
- `/app/donations/success/<post_id>/` - Success page
- `/app/donations/failed/<post_id>/` - Failed page  
- `/app/donations/cancelled/<post_id>/` - Cancelled page

Kept legacy endpoint for backward compatibility:
- `/app/donations/execute/<post_id>/` - Shows "unsupported" message

---

### Dependencies (`requirements.txt`)
- **Added:** `requests==2.32.3` (for REST API calls)
- **Added:** `python-decouple==3.8` (already used, now documented)
- **Removed:** `paypalrestsdk` (deprecated, no longer needed)

---

## How It Works Now

### 1. User clicks "Donate"
- Modal opens with donation form
- User selects amount and enters optional message

### 2. User clicks PayPal button
- **Frontend** calls `/app/donations/create/<post_id>/`
- **Backend** creates order via PayPal API, returns `order_id`
- **Frontend** returns `order_id` to PayPal SDK
- PayPal popup opens with approval page

### 3. User approves in PayPal popup
- **PayPal** calls `onApprove()` callback
- **Frontend** calls `/app/donations/capture/<post_id>/` with `order_id`
- **Backend** captures payment via PayPal API
- **Backend** updates donation status to 'completed'
- **Backend** sends email notification
- **Frontend** redirects to success page

### 4. User cancels or closes popup
- **PayPal** calls `onCancel()` callback
- **Frontend** calls `/app/donations/cancel/<post_id>/` with `order_id`
- **Backend** marks donation as 'cancelled'
- Modal closes, user stays on same page

---

## Testing Steps

1. **Restart Django server:**
   ```powershell
   # Stop server (Ctrl+C)
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

2. **Clear browser cache:**
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+Delete`
   - Clear cached images and files
   - Or hard refresh with `Ctrl+F5`

3. **Test donation flow:**
   - Go to Dashboard or Church Detail page
   - Click "Donate" on any post with donations enabled
   - Enter amount (e.g., ₱250)
   - Click PayPal button
   - **PayPal popup should open without errors**
   - Log in with sandbox buyer account (Ramdar Louie)
   - Approve payment
   - Should redirect to success page

4. **Test cancellation:**
   - Click Donate → select amount → click PayPal
   - Close the PayPal popup
   - Donation should be marked as 'cancelled' in admin

---

## Configuration

Your `.env` is already configured:
```env
PAYPAL_MODE=sandbox
PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=AW7JbaEzOdoR4egGvE5FELB1uJ-ZGdtiNXI4yPl4W9LoI0d4wnqBErf0p2XFJob1VrhNRYiHToQ0SF32
PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET=EFEj0k2p61-xmn6BTNs-Rys--W2bUgAJ0OptYiuQK8zy4Pf3UOCZ6cB-7nk9hMGv-RfY73q_8T8udqOf
PAYPAL_CURRENCY=PHP
SITE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

### Sandbox Accounts
- **Business (receives donations):** John Doe - BMP78M587UDD2 (PHP 49,833 balance)
- **Buyer (makes donations):** Ramdar Louie - GC7A76UJW389N (PHP 100,000 balance)

## Benefits of New Integration

✅ **No more sandbox errors** - Orders API is fully supported  
✅ **Better UX** - No page redirects, everything in popup  
✅ **Faster** - Fewer round trips, direct API calls  
✅ **More reliable** - Modern API with better error handling  
✅ **Easier debugging** - Detailed logs in Django console  
✅ **Future-proof** - Won't be deprecated like Payments API

## Troubleshooting

### If PayPal popup still shows error:
1. **Check Django console** for error messages
2. **Verify sandbox account** is linked to your Client ID
3. **Try USD** temporarily to test if currency is the issue:
   ```env
   PAYPAL_CURRENCY=USD
   ```
4. **Check PayPal Developer Dashboard**:
   - Apps & Credentials → [Your App]
   - Sandbox Business Account should be "John Doe"

### If donation stays "pending":
- Check if `capture_donation` endpoint is being called
- Check Django console for capture errors
- Verify PayPal credentials are correct

### If PayPal button doesn't appear:
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify PayPal SDK is loaded (view page source)
- Make sure `PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID` is in template context

---

## Next Steps (Future Enhancements)

### 1. Production Setup
When ready to go live:
```env
PAYPAL_MODE=live
PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=<your_live_client_id>
PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET=<your_live_secret>
SITE_URL=https://yourdomain.com
```

### 2. Church Payouts
Currently all donations go to your platform account. To pay churches:

**Option A: Manual Payouts**
- Review donations in Django admin
- Manually send PayPal transfers to each church

**Option B: PayPal Payouts API**
- Automate bulk payouts to churches
- Schedule monthly/weekly distributions
- Track payout history

**Option C: PayPal Commerce Platform**
- Churches connect their PayPal accounts
- Automatic splits at checkout time
- Like Stripe Connect

### 3. Webhooks (Optional)
Enable real-time notifications from PayPal:
- Go to PayPal Developer Dashboard → Webhooks
- Add webhook URL: `https://yourdomain.com/app/donations/webhook/`
- Select events: `CHECKOUT.ORDER.APPROVED`, `PAYMENT.CAPTURE.COMPLETED`
- PayPal will notify your server of payment events
