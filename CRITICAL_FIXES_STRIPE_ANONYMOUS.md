# Critical Bug Fixes - Stripe & Anonymous User Errors

## Date: 2025-10-15

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Stripe Payment Confirmation Error (500)
**Error:** `ERROR Stripe payment confirmation error: charges`

**Location:** `core/donation_views.py` - `confirm_stripe_payment()` function

**Root Cause:**
The code was trying to access `payment_intent.charges` attribute directly, but the Stripe PaymentIntent object doesn't include charges by default - they need to be explicitly expanded.

**Fix Applied:**
```python
# Before (line 610):
payment_intent = stripe.PaymentIntent.retrieve(payment_intent_id)

# After:
payment_intent = stripe.PaymentIntent.retrieve(
    payment_intent_id,
    expand=['latest_charge']
)
```

Also updated the charge handling logic to:
- Use `latest_charge` instead of `charges.data[0]`
- Add proper attribute checking with `hasattr()`
- Handle both string IDs and expanded objects
- Use safer attribute access patterns

**Result:**
- Stripe payments now complete successfully without 500 errors
- Charge IDs are properly stored in the database
- Payment method details are captured when available

### 2. AnonymousUser Landing Page Error (500)
**Error:** `AttributeError: 'AnonymousUser' object has no attribute 'get_full_name'`

**Location:** `core/utils.py` - `get_user_display_data()` function

**Root Cause:**
The function was calling `user.get_full_name()` without checking if the user is authenticated. When anonymous users (not logged in) visit the landing page, Django's `AnonymousUser` object doesn't have the `get_full_name()` method, causing a crash.

**Fix Applied:**
```python
def get_user_display_data(user, profile):
    """
    Get user display name and initial for UI.
    
    Args:
        user: User instance (can be AnonymousUser)
        profile: Profile instance (can be None)
    
    Returns:
        tuple: (display_name, user_initial)
    """
    # Handle anonymous users
    if not user.is_authenticated:
        return 'Guest', 'G'
    
    # ... rest of the function
```

**Result:**
- Landing page now works correctly for anonymous users
- No more 500 errors when unauthenticated users visit the site
- Anonymous users are displayed as "Guest" with initial "G"

## Impact

### Before Fixes:
1. ❌ Stripe donations failed with 500 error (but payment still went through)
2. ❌ Landing page crashed for anonymous users
3. ❌ Poor user experience with error messages

### After Fixes:
1. ✅ Stripe donations complete successfully
2. ✅ Landing page works for all users (authenticated and anonymous)
3. ✅ Smooth user experience
4. ✅ Proper error handling and logging

## Testing Recommendations

### Test Stripe Donations:
1. Go to a post with donations enabled
2. Click "Donate with Credit Card"
3. Enter test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
4. Complete the payment
5. Verify success message appears
6. Check that donation appears in Manage Church > Donations tab

### Test Anonymous User Access:
1. Log out completely
2. Visit the landing page at `/`
3. Verify page loads without errors
4. Check that navigation works correctly
5. Try logging in from the landing page

## Files Modified

1. `core/utils.py` - Added anonymous user check in `get_user_display_data()`
2. `core/donation_views.py` - Fixed Stripe charge retrieval in `confirm_stripe_payment()`

---

## Notes

- The Stripe webhook handler already had proper charge handling, so it continues to work correctly
- The fix is backward compatible - existing code continues to work
- Both fixes follow Django best practices for user authentication checks
- Proper logging is maintained for debugging purposes
