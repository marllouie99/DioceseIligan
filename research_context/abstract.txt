# CHURCHILIGAN: INTEGRATED CHURCH MANAGEMENT AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT PLATFORM

## ABSTRACT

ChurchIligan is a comprehensive web-based platform designed to streamline parish administration and enhance community engagement for Roman Catholic churches in the Philippines. This research presents the development and implementation of an integrated digital solution that addresses the operational challenges faced by parish administrators in managing donations, service bookings, event coordination, and community communication. Built using Django 5.2.6 framework with PostgreSQL database and cloud-based storage, the system integrates secure payment processing through PayPal and Stripe for donation management, enabling transparent fundraising campaigns with goal tracking and progress visualization. The platform provides a sophisticated booking system for sacramental services including baptism, weddings, and confessions, featuring intelligent scheduling with conflict detection and automated notification workflows. Parish administrators can manage their organizations through role-based access controls (owner, manager, staff), while parishioners can discover parishes, book services, make donations, and engage through social features including posts, comments, and real-time notifications. The system incorporates Philippine-specific address structures (region, province, city/municipality, barangay) and implements robust security measures including email verification, IP tracking, and rate limiting. Key functionalities include parish verification workflows, review and rating systems, comprehensive analytics dashboards, and insightful reporting tools that enable data-driven decision-making. ChurchIligan successfully demonstrates how modern web technologies can enhance transparency in charitable activities, improve parish-community communication, and allow parish staff to focus on their pastoral mission while efficiently managing administrative operations.
