STUDY CONTEXT:


The researchers plan to develop an integrated digital platform designed specifically for the parish administration or staff to efficiently manage a range of activities and services. This platform will streamline the process of accepting and organizing goods donations for parish-led outreach programs while also providing features for event reservations and the distribution of digital bulletins. Through a user-friendly platform interface, parish admins or staffs will be able to manage donations, reservation, post announcements, and deliver weekly sermon summaries and updates to the congregation. The system aims to enhance communication, promote community engagement, and ensure transparency in charitable activities, while generating insightful reports to support effective parish operations.

Statement of the Problem
The researchers have recognized the following problems that highlight the need for a digital solution to improve parish operations and communication. These issues reflect the limitations of current manual systems used by parish in Iligan City, which hinder efficient management of donations, events, and information sharing:
1. Despite the active participation of citizen in outreach and religious activities, many parish in Iligan City lack a centralized and accessible platform for managing donations, making it challenging to coordinate, track, and distribute goods for parish-led outreach programs efficiently.
2. Unlike restaurants and businesses that have their own platforms to promote products and services, some parish in Iligan City do not have a dedicated system to post bulletins, announcements, or sermon content. Instead, they rely on third-party social media platforms. Since the proposed system already includes features like event reservations, and donation integrating a built-in bulletin or content posting module would allow members to see updates directly while interacting with the system making communication more efficient, centralized, and accessible for all.
3. The use of outdated and manual methods for handling event reservations in parish across Iligan City leads to inefficiencies in organizing parish activities. These traditional systems often result in scheduling conflicts, miscommunication among members, and poor allocation of parish resources, affecting overall parish operations and member participation.


Objectives of the Study
The objective of this study is to design and develop an integrated digital platform designed specifically for the parish of Iligan City. These are the following objectives:
1. To design and develop a centralized and user-friendly digital platform that enables parish in Iligan City to efficiently manage, coordinate, track, and distribute goods donations for their outreach programs. 
2. To develop a built-in posting feature within the platform that allows parish to directly share bulletins, announcements, and sermon summaries with members providing a centralized alternative to third-party social media platforms.
3. To incorporate an event reservation feature into the digital platform, enabling parish admins or staff to efficiently schedule, organize, and manage activities, while minimizing conflicts and optimizing the use of parish resources.

Scope and Limitations
This study will be conducted in Iligan City, Philippines. The main purpose of this study is to develop a system that will allow parish administrators and members to manage goods and money donations, make event reservations, and receive digital bulletins, announcements, and sermon summaries. The platform is designed to improve current manual methods and ensure that parish leaders and citizens stay well-informed and connected, making it easier to organize outreach activities and parish events.
Security is taken care of by making the parish staff to log in using their separate accounts. The platform is convenient to navigate both web and mobile and allow parish leaders to post needs, record donations, manage events and update.
It allows citizens to log in and read the last bulletins and summaries of the sermons as well as respond to the received offerings requests, and get acquainted with upcoming events. Its mobile application is usable on iOS and Android, and this is why the members find it easy to follow the happenings, RSVP events, monitor donations, and even listen to sermons whenever they are traveling.
Simple web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL) are applied in combination with the mobile app framework (React Native or Flutter) to accomplish everything user-friendly.
The parish admins or staff are responsible for updating donation lists, entering new events, and sharing announcements. All records of donations, event participation, and updates are stored for easy viewing and management. The system can also generate simple reports based on the data entered, helping parish staff track donations and event engagement over time.
However, there are certain limitations to this system. The system relies on a stable internet connection and basic security measures. It does not include advanced data protection features or technical support after deployment. Additionally, promoting activities outside the parish community or integrating with other parish management systems is not part of the scope of this research.




The study is a comprehensive web-based platform designed to streamline parish administration and enhance community engagement for Roman Catholic churches in the Philippines. This research presents the development and implementation of an integrated digital solution that addresses the operational challenges faced by parish administrators in managing donations, service bookings, event coordination, and community communication. Built using Django 5.2.6 framework with PostgreSQL database and cloud-based storage, the system integrates secure payment processing through PayPal and Stripe for donation management, enabling transparent fundraising campaigns with goal tracking and progress visualization. The platform provides a sophisticated booking system for sacramental services including baptism, weddings, and confessions, featuring intelligent scheduling with conflict detection and automated notification workflows. Parish administrators can manage their organizations through role-based access controls (owner, manager, staff), while parishioners can discover parishes, book services, make donations, and engage through social features including posts, comments, and real-time notifications. The system incorporates Philippine-specific address structures (region, province, city/municipality, barangay) and implements robust security measures including email verification, IP tracking, and rate limiting. Key functionalities include parish verification workflows, review and rating systems, comprehensive analytics dashboards, and insightful reporting tools that enable data-driven decision-making. This studyâ€ƒ
successfully demonstrates how modern web technologies can enhance transparency in charitable activities, improve parish-community communication, and allow parish staff to focus on their pastoral mission while efficiently managing administrative operations.
