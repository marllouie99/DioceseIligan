# Donation Payment Flow Documentation

## üéØ Overview

This document explains how the church-specific donation payment system works in ChurchIligan.

## üìã System Architecture

### **Option Implemented: Church Profile Payment Setup**

Churches must configure their PayPal email in their Church Profile **before** they can enable donations on posts.

## üîÑ Payment Flow

### **Step 1: Church Setup (One-Time)**

1. Church owner navigates to **Manage Church ‚Üí Settings Tab**
2. Clicks on **Payment Settings** in the sidebar
3. Enters their PayPal email address
4. Saves the church profile

**Status Indicator:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Yellow warning dot appears if PayPal email is not set
- ‚úÖ Green checkmark when PayPal email is configured

### **Step 2: Creating Donation-Enabled Posts**

1. Church creates a new post (general or event)
2. Toggles "Enable Donations" checkbox
3. **Validation occurs:**
   - ‚úÖ If `church.paypal_email` exists ‚Üí Post can be created
   - ‚ùå If `church.paypal_email` is empty ‚Üí Error message shown:
     ```
     "Please set up your PayPal email in Church Profile settings before 
     enabling donations. This is required to receive donation payments directly."
     ```

### **Step 3: Donor Makes a Donation**

1. Donor clicks "Donate" button on a post
2. **Backend validation:**
   - Checks if `post.enable_donation == True`
   - Checks if `post.church.paypal_email` exists
   - If missing ‚Üí Error: "This church has not set up their payment method yet"
3. Donor enters amount, message, and anonymous preference
4. PayPal payment is created with:
   - **Payee email**: `post.church.paypal_email`
   - **Transaction description**: Includes church name and cause
   - **Item description**: References church PayPal email

### **Step 4: Payment Processing**

1. Payment goes to **platform's PayPal account** (via configured credentials)
2. Transaction includes church's PayPal email in the payee field
3. Donation record stores:
   - `donor` - Who donated
   - `post` - Which post received the donation
   - `amount` - Donation amount
   - `church.paypal_email` - Where funds should go

### **Step 5: Fund Distribution**

**Current Implementation:**
- Funds collect in platform's PayPal account
- Platform must manually/automatically transfer to churches using:
  - PayPal Mass Payouts API
  - Manual PayPal transfers
  - Scheduled batch transfers

**Future Enhancement:**
- Implement PayPal Payouts API for automatic distribution
- Add payout schedule configuration
- Create payout history tracking

## üìä Database Schema

### **Church Model**
```python
class Church(models.Model):
    # ... existing fields ...
    paypal_email = models.EmailField(
        blank=True, 
        null=True, 
        help_text="PayPal email for receiving donations"
    )
```

### **Donation Model**
```python
class Donation(models.Model):
    post = models.ForeignKey('Post', ...)
    donor = models.ForeignKey(User, ...)
    amount = models.DecimalField(...)
    payment_method = models.CharField(default='paypal')
    payment_status = models.CharField(...)  # pending, completed, failed
    paypal_order_id = models.CharField(...)
    # ... other fields ...
```

## üé® User Interface

   - Success (green) if PayPal configured

## ‚úÖ Validation Rules

### **Church Profile Form**
- PayPal email is **optional** (not required to create church)
- Must be valid email format if provided

### **Post Creation/Update Form**
- If `enable_donation == True`:
  - Church **must** have `paypal_email` set
  - Otherwise, validation error is raised

### **Donation Creation**
- Post must exist and be active
- Post must have `enable_donation == True`
- Church must have `paypal_email` set
- Amount must be ‚â• ‚Ç±10

## üîí Security Considerations

1. **PayPal Email Validation:**
   - Email format validation
   - No verification that email is active PayPal account (user responsibility)

2. **Payment Processing:**
   - Uses platform's PayPal credentials (secure)
   - Church email stored in transaction metadata
   - No direct access to donor payment info

3. **Fund Distribution:**
   - Platform acts as intermediary
   - Requires trust between churches and platform
   - Manual/API payouts provide audit trail

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

### **Phase 1: Automatic Payouts**
- Integrate PayPal Payouts API
- Schedule automatic transfers (daily/weekly/monthly)
- Email notifications for payouts

### **Phase 2: Multiple Payment Methods**
- Add GCash support
- Add bank transfer option
- Add PayMongo integration

### **Phase 3: Advanced Features**
- Payout history dashboard
- Tax receipt generation
- Donation analytics per church
- Refund handling

### **Phase 4: Direct Church Payments**
- Allow churches to use their own PayPal apps
- Implement PayPal Partner/Marketplace API
- True peer-to-peer donations

## üìù Important Notes

### **Current Limitations**

1. **Not Direct Church-to-Donor:**
   - Payments go through platform account
   - Requires manual/API distribution
   - Platform fee potential exists

2. **PayPal Only:**
   - No alternative payment methods yet
   - Philippines-specific considerations needed
   - Currency limited to configured option (PHP)

3. **Email Verification:**
   - System doesn't verify if PayPal email is valid
   - Church responsible for accuracy
   - Invalid email = failed transfers

### **Best Practices**

1. **For Churches:**
   - Use PayPal Business account
   - Verify email address with PayPal
   - Keep contact info updated
   - Monitor donation notifications

2. **For Platform Admin:**
   - Process payouts regularly
   - Monitor donation records
   - Handle disputes promptly
   - Maintain audit trail

3. **For Donors:**
   - Check church is verified
   - Save donation receipts
   - Contact church for questions
   - Report suspicious activity
