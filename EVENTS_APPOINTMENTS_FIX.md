# Events & Appointments Page Fixes

**Date:** October 21, 2025  
**Issues Fixed:** 2 critical bugs affecting Events and Appointments pages

---

## Issue 1: Events Page Not Displaying Event-Type Posts

### Problem
The Events page (`/events/`) was not displaying any event posts even though event posts existed in the database. The view was filtering too strictly, only showing events with `event_start_date >= now`, which excluded:
- Ongoing events (started in the past but ending in the future)
- Undated events (both start and end dates are null)

### Root Cause
In `core/views.py`, the `events()` view used a restrictive filter:
```python
base_filter = {
    'is_active': True,
    'post_type': 'event',
    'church__is_active': True,
    'event_start_date__gte': now,  # Too restrictive!
}
```

This filter excluded events that:
- Had already started but were still ongoing
- Were created without specific dates (undated/TBD events)

### Solution
Updated the filter to use Django Q expressions to include:
1. **Upcoming events**: `event_start_date >= now`
2. **Ongoing events**: `event_end_date >= now`
3. **Undated events**: Both `event_start_date` and `event_end_date` are null

**Updated Code** (`core/views.py`, lines 1075-1086):
```python
# Common filter for active event posts including:
# - Upcoming events (start_date >= now)
# - Ongoing events (end_date >= now)
# - Undated events (both start and end are null)
base_q = (
    Q(is_active=True, post_type='event', church__is_active=True)
    & (
        Q(event_start_date__gte=now)
        | Q(event_end_date__gte=now)
        | (Q(event_start_date__isnull=True) & Q(event_end_date__isnull=True))
    )
)
```

### Files Modified
- `core/views.py` (lines 1075-1126)

### Impact
- ✅ Events page now displays all relevant event posts
- ✅ Ongoing events remain visible until they end
- ✅ Undated/TBD events are included
- ✅ Performance optimizations (select_related, annotations) preserved

## Issue 2: Appointments Page JavaScript Syntax Error

### Problem
The Appointments page (`/appointments/`) threw a JavaScript syntax error:
```
appointments/:329 Uncaught SyntaxError: missing ) after argument list
```

This prevented the appointment summary modal from opening when users clicked the "View Summary" button.

### Root Cause
In `templates/core/my_appointments.html`, the inline `onclick` handler for `openAppointmentSummary()` had improperly escaped address arguments:

**Problematic Code** (line 117):
```django
'{% if b.church.street_address %}{{ b.church.street_address }}, {% endif %}...{% endif %}|escapejs',
```

The issue was:
1. The `|escapejs` filter was placed **outside** the closing quote, making it part of the template syntax instead of the string value
2. Complex conditional address concatenation created parsing issues
3. User address had the same problem (line 130)

### Solution
1. **Church Address**: Use the `Church.full_address` property (which already formats the address correctly) with proper escaping:
   ```django
   '{{ b.church.full_address|escapejs }}',
   ```

2. **User Address**: Wrap the conditional address building in a `{% filter escapejs %}...{% endfilter %}` block:
   ```django
   '{% filter escapejs %}{% if b.user.profile.street_address %}{{ b.user.profile.street_address }}, {% endif %}...{% endfilter %}',
   ```

### Files Modified
- `templates/core/my_appointments.html` (lines 112-139)

### Impact
- ✅ JavaScript syntax error resolved
- ✅ Appointment summary modal opens correctly
- ✅ All address data properly escaped (prevents XSS)
- ✅ Cleaner, more maintainable code

## Testing Checklist

### Events Page
- [ ] Navigate to `/events/`
- [ ] Verify event posts are displayed
- [ ] Check that upcoming events appear
- [ ] Check that ongoing events appear (if any exist)
- [ ] Verify pagination works
- [ ] Check sidebar "Other Upcoming Events"
- [ ] Verify no console errors

### Appointments Page
- [ ] Navigate to `/appointments/`
- [ ] Click "View Summary" button on any appointment
- [ ] Verify modal opens without errors
- [ ] Check that church address displays correctly
- [ ] Check that user address displays correctly
- [ ] Verify all appointment details render properly
- [ ] Test with appointments that have special characters in addresses
- [ ] Verify no console errors

## Recommendations for Future Improvements

### 1. **Refactor Inline Event Handlers**
**Current Issue**: Inline `onclick` handlers with 20+ arguments are fragile and hard to maintain.

**Recommendation**: Use data attributes instead:
```html
<button class="booking-icon-btn" 
        data-booking-id="{{ b.id }}"
        data-action="view-summary">
    <i data-feather="eye"></i>
</button>
```

Then in JavaScript:
```javascript
document.querySelectorAll('[data-action="view-summary"]').forEach(btn => {
    btn.addEventListener('click', function() {
        const bookingId = this.dataset.bookingId;
        fetchBookingDetails(bookingId).then(openAppointmentSummary);
    });
});
```

**Benefits**:
- No escaping issues
- Easier to maintain
- Better separation of concerns
- Can fetch fresh data from API

### 2. **Add Event Status Indicators**
Display visual indicators for event status:
- 🟢 **Upcoming** (starts in the future)
- 🔵 **Ongoing** (started, not ended)
- 🟡 **TBD** (no dates set)

### 3. **Add Event Filtering**
Allow users to filter events by:
- Date range
- Church
- Event type/category
- Location

### 4. **Improve Event Date Handling**
- Add validation to prevent `event_end_date < event_start_date`
- Add timezone support for multi-region churches
- Show "All Day" for events without specific times

### 5. **Add Address Validation**
- Validate Philippine address format on form submission
- Use Google Places API for address autocomplete
- Store coordinates for map integration

### 6. **Performance Optimization**
Consider adding database indexes:
```python
class Meta:
    indexes = [
        models.Index(fields=['post_type', 'event_start_date', 'is_active']),
        models.Index(fields=['post_type', 'event_end_date', 'is_active']),
    ]
```

## Code Quality Notes

### What Was Done Well
✅ Used Django Q expressions for complex queries  
✅ Preserved existing performance optimizations (select_related, annotations)  
✅ Used proper template filters for XSS prevention  
✅ Maintained backward compatibility  

### Areas for Improvement
⚠️ Inline event handlers with many arguments  
⚠️ Complex template logic in onclick attributes  
⚠️ No unit tests for event filtering logic  
⚠️ No integration tests for appointment modal  

---

## Summary

Both critical issues have been resolved:

1. **Events Page**: Now correctly displays upcoming, ongoing, and undated event posts using improved query filters.

2. **Appointments Page**: JavaScript syntax error fixed by properly escaping inline onclick arguments using `full_address` property and `{% filter escapejs %}` blocks.

The fixes follow Django best practices and maintain the existing code architecture while improving reliability and maintainability.

**Next Steps**: Test both pages thoroughly and consider implementing the recommended improvements for better long-term maintainability.
