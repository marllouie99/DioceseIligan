# Profile Card Alignment Fix

## Problem
Several alignment issues were present in the profile card:
1. **Camera icon** was positioned awkwardly below the avatar
2. **Inconsistent spacing** between "Member since" and location information
3. Meta information was displayed in a single line instead of stacked vertically

## Solution
Fixed positioning and spacing issues in the profile card for better visual alignment and readability.

## Changes Made

### 1. Camera Icon Button (`static/css/app.css`)

**Before:**
```css
.avatar-upload-btn {
  bottom: 0;
  right: 0;
  width: 32px;
  height: 32px;
}
```

**After:**
```css
.avatar-upload-btn {
  bottom: -4px;
  right: -4px;
  width: 36px;
  height: 36px;
  box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);
}
```

**Changes:**
- Moved button position from `0, 0` to `-4px, -4px` for better overlap with avatar
- Increased size from `32px` to `36px` for better visibility
- Increased icon size from `16px` to `18px`
- Enhanced shadow for better depth

### 2. Profile Meta Information Spacing

**Before:**
```css
.profile-meta {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  gap: 8px;
}
```

**After:**
```css
.profile-meta {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  gap: 8px;
}

.meta-item {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  gap: 8px;
}
```

**Changes:**
- Changed from horizontal to **vertical layout** (flex-direction: column)
- Each meta item (Member since, Location) now displays on its own line
- Consistent 8px gap between items
- Added `.meta-item` class for individual meta entries

### 3. Content Spacing Adjustments

**Updated margins:**
- `.profile-email`: margin-bottom increased from `8px` to `12px`
- `.profile-bio`: margin-bottom increased from `16px` to `12px`
- `.profile-meta`: gap increased from `6px` to `8px`

### 4. HTML Structure (`templates/manage_profile.html`)

**Before:**
```html
<div class="profile-meta">
  <svg class="meta-icon">...</svg>
  <span>Member since {{ user.date_joined|date:"F Y" }}</span>
</div>
```

**After:**
```html
<div class="profile-meta">
  <div class="meta-item">
    <svg class="meta-icon">...</svg>
    <span>Member since {{ user.date_joined|date:"F Y" }}</span>
  </div>
  {% if profile.city or profile.province %}
  <div class="meta-item">
    <svg class="meta-icon">...</svg>
    <span>{{ profile.barangay }}, {{ profile.city }}, {{ profile.province }}</span>
  </div>
  {% endif %}
</div>
```

**Changes:**
- Wrapped each meta item in a `.meta-item` div
- Added location information with conditional display
- Each item now has its own icon and text
- Location shows barangay, city, and province when available
